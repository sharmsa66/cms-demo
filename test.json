The foreign exchange rate is provided by CIBC to the Auction Company. You are not required to use the Online Platform to pay auction payments to the Auction Company. You are at all times entitled to source the Auction Currency from alternate financial institutions, including Your local financial institution. <em> <strong> CIBC earns income from the difference (the spread) between the prices at which we buy and sell foreign currency.
